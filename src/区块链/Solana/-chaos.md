#### Transaction

```rust
/// (2024-10-19)
/// An atomically-committed sequence of instructions.
///
/// While [`Instruction`]s are the basic unit of computation in Solana,
/// they are submitted by clients in [`Transaction`]s containing one or
/// more instructions, and signed by one or more [`Signer`]s.
///
/// [`Signer`]: crate::signer::Signer
///
/// See the [module documentation] for more details about transactions.
///
/// [module documentation]: self
///
/// Some constructors accept an optional `payer`, the account responsible for
/// paying the cost of executing a transaction. In most cases, callers should
/// specify the payer explicitly in these constructors. In some cases though,
/// the caller is not _required_ to specify the payer, but is still allowed to:
/// in the [`Message`] structure, the first account is always the fee-payer, so
/// if the caller has knowledge that the first account of the constructed
/// transaction's `Message` is both a signer and the expected fee-payer, then
/// redundantly specifying the fee-payer is not strictly required.
